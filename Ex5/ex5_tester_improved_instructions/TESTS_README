These are Evyatar's tests from Google Drive, adapted to be run directly via JUnit (in IntelliJ) rather than Python.
This will allow you to debug your program more easily, as well as use IntelliJ's built in diffing tool while debugging
errors.

These should work on both Windows and Linux(haven't tested on Mac, I assume it should work there too).
Note that 4 tests were disabled for non-Windows OS (they use a windows only hidden attribute) - in that case, you'll get
a special failing test indicating so. (It doesn't mean an error on your code, it only serves as a remainder to run the
tests on Windows too)

== Installation ==
These assume you're using IntelliJ.

Drop the tests folder into your project's root directory(which IntelliJ creates for you, it's where
 folders such as 'src', 'out', '.idea' usually appear) - so that the folder tree should look like this:

ex5/
ex5/tests
ex5/out
ex5/src
ex5/src/filesprocessing/DirectoryProcessor.java  - this file must exist, and this class MUST BE PUBLIC, the 'main' method
                                                    MUST BE PUBLIC as well.

(where 'ex5' is the name of your project's root directory)

Then, you'll need to configure 'tests' as a test directory, do so as follows:

File -> Project Structure -> Modules
under the 'Sources' tab, you should see your project's file tree. Right click 'tests' and choose 'tests'
Now, the tests icon should become green.

Then, you'll need to add the junit test library, do the following:
File -> Project Structure -> Libraries > + > From Maven
paste the following:
org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-params:5.4.0
Ensure that "Transitive Dependencies" is selected as well.
Press the magnifying glass, it will take some time for results to appear. Then, press the box, select this library,
and click OK.
It should then prompt you to add this to the module, press OK and you're done.


Now, everything should be ready to work

== Running ==
Right click 'tests' and click "Run 'all tests'".
