=============================
The book was designed in a way that it is not necessarily connected to a library, it could be registered
to one library, many libraries, or not registered at all.
The same thing goes for the patron.
For the library, every library has its own records of registered books and patrons, and it can manipulate
just its records, and does not effect other libraries databases.
In order to manipulate the different instances of books and patrons in a library, I used the composition,
the Library class has two arrays, one of Book objects, and one for Patron objects.
This design is consistent with the OOP principles: modularity and readability. Also, it is the same of how
library systems acts in the real world: not every single book or patron is registered to library, and
libraries systems are separate, and free to choose which book or patron to register.

=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In the Library class, I created for the Book array two parallel arrays that contains in the same index
information about the book status in that index the Book array, to be specific, I created bookIDs array,
which contains the book ID in the same index of that book in the registered books array, the second array is
_availableBooks which contains true in the same index if book is available, otherwise, false.
also I keep a counter for the added books.
The same goes for registered patrons array, I created patronIDs array, and _booksPerPatron array which counts
how many books the patron in that index has borrowed, also I keep a counter for added patrons.
